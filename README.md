# Introduction..
<br>
An End-to-End Machine Learning Model is a comprehensive system that contains all the stages of a machine learning project, from data collection and preprocessing to model development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. The comparison of multiple Machine Learning models refers to training, evaluating, and analyzing the performance of different algorithms on the same dataset to identify which model performs best for a specific predictive task. This machine learning model is done on Python. The project aims to create a platform for managing and listing properties for sale or rent. It provides a user-friendly interface for both real estate agents and customers to interact and transact.
